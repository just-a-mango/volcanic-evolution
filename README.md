/!\Secret/!\

If you read this, you're either Just_a_Mango(me) either someone Just_a_Mango approved to work with.
So basically, simple rules : don't do anything stupid, don't delete everything, don't create a new public repository with the existing code, don't do any stuff of that kind...
Also, if Just_a_Mango(me) put you in charge(which I don't believe a second but anyway), don't ban him(me) like an asshole just to have the mod all to yourself(He(I)'d still have the Curseforge page and the project source file lol)
OK, I think that's it, good luck with coding and I'll see you later!
